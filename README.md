Statisical Problem (Analysis of Variance)

# Problem 1
Prepared an aligned residual dot plots by agenta and normal probability plot (Q-Q plot) of the residuals.

# Problem 2
  In a completely randomized design to study the effect of  the  speed  of  winding  thread  
(1:slow,  2:normal,  3:fast,  4:maximum)  onto  75-yardspools, 16 runs of 10,000 spools each 
were made at each of the four winding speeds.The response variable is the number of thread breaks
during the production run.  Sincethe responses are counts, the researcher was concerned about the normality
and equalvariance assumptions of the ANOVA model.

To solve: 
Obtained the fitted values and residuals of the ANOVA model.
Performed the Brown-Forsythe test, Hartleyâ€™s test, and the Box-Cox procedure
